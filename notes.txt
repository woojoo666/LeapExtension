NOTES:

content script doesn't work because the simulated event isn't sent to the actual dom (probably because the content script runs in a sandbox)

leapextension.js is hosted on github
inject.js injects a script element into the page, which loads leapextension.js

BUGS:

sometimes (like on google.com) get error "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined (leapExtension.js:9)", jQuery not loading cause of dynamic loading?
